## Drush

Installs one or more versions of [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) system-wide.
It is installed to `/opt/drush/DRUSH_VERSION/` and a symlink to each
executable file is placed in `/usr/local/bin/`.

Installation is done via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Features:

  * Configures bash integration
  * Download of Drush extensions
  * Definition of Drush aliases
  * Optionally install command dependencies (wget, git, gzip, rsync, ...)

It doesn't goes crazy to provide a freaking Drush commands interface
to run with Puppet.
