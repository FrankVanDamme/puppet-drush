# Drush

Installs [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) and allows to define global
configuration, aliases and extensions.

Installation is performed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It is done
system-wide in `/usr/share/php/composer` and a symlink to Drush executable is
placed in `/usr/local/bin`.

It doesn't goes crazy to provide a freaking drush commands interface.


# Example usage

  - drush

drush::extensions :
  - drush_extras
